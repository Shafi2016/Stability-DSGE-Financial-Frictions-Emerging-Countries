Dynare codes for reproducing the output of the paper for seven models with Impluse response function with Stochastic steady state
_A, represents model with Additive Risk Premium
_M, shows the model with Multiplicative Risk Premium
To reproduce the output of the paper with different pruning techniques, Please Dynare add-on for "Pruning in Perturbation DSGE Models" https://econpapers.repec.org/software/dgeqmrbcd/196.htm by
Hong Lan (lanhongken@gmail.com) and Alexander Meyer-Gohde.
Use the same parameter values as given in the paper.
